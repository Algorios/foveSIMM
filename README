This directory contains the description of foveSIMM, a formally
verified Standard Initial Margin Model (SIMM). In detail, you find

- foveSIMM.pdf a description of foveSIMM.

- Five Isabelle-2019 theory files with the formalization:

  * Linear_Interpolation.thy: Theory files to define the interpolation
    of two given points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) as a linear function
    f(x) = a*(x-b) + c.

  * Percentile.thy: The percentile function is defined as a linear
    approximation between points defined for a partial function
    defined for finitely many elements.

  * Percentile_Code.thy: An executable definition of the percentile
    function.

  * foveSIMM_Values.thy: An Isabelle representation of the values
    provided in the openSIMM example.

  * foveSIMM: A reconstruction of the openSIMM example in Isabelle/HOL
    with an extraction of corresponding Scala code.

- Three sub-directories with the experiments done with the
  Isabelle/HOL code, each containing the five theory files mentioned above:

  * extension-experiment: Extension of the Percentile function to the
    full unit interval by taking the neighbouring slope.

  * extension-experiment-max: Extension of the Percentile function to
    the full unit interval by taking the steepest slope.

  * shift-experiment: Redefining the Percentile function by shifting
    it along the x-axis.
